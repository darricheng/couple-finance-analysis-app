This is an old iteration of my idea for a personal finance app. See the [finance-app repository](https://github.com/darricheng/finance-app) for a more up-to-date of what I'm building for my finance app.

# Finance Analysis App

My partner and I use different methods and apps to keep track of our finances that we're each comfortable with, but we also want to view our spending habits together as a couple so that we can make better financial decisions for our future.

While there are products out there that can already do this, most of them are paid and force you into using their app to get the features that we want, i.e. combined analysis of finances.

This project is my attempt at creating an app that accepts finance data from different sources in various formats to create graphs and charts that help groups of indidividuals better manage their finances together.
